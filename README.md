Pausify is more than an app: it's a catalyst for change. Developed to transform the way you relate to screens, it empowers you to regain control of your time and build more intentional usage habits. By managing your screen time intelligently, you not only invest in your personal development but also contribute to a significant social impact.

## ‚ú® Overview

Pausify monitors your usage time on specific applications and boosts your motivation through a financial "loss" system. You choose which applications to monitor, set a usage time goal, and block a certain amount of money within the app. If you exceed your goal, the money is sent to a charity organization of your choice. If you meet your goal, the money is returned to you.

This mechanism leverages the "fear of losing money" as a strong motivation to help users decrease their mobile phone dependence and, over time, gradually overcome addiction.

* **Positive Social Impact:** Each unmet goal translates into a donation to a noble cause, turning a slip-up into a significant contribution.
* **Control and Autonomy:** Empowers users to regain control over their time and digital habits.
