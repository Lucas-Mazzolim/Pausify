# üì± Purify

Purify is more than an app: it's a catalyst for change. Developed to transform the way you relate to screens, it empowers you to regain control of your time and build more intentional usage habits. By managing your screen time intelligently, you not only invest in your personal development but also contribute to a significant social impact.

## ‚ú® Overview

Purify monitors your usage time on specific applications and boosts your motivation through a financial "loss" system. You choose which applications to monitor, set a usage time goal, and block a certain amount of money within the app. If you exceed your goal, the money is sent to a charity organization of your choice. If you meet your goal, the money is returned to you.

This mechanism leverages the "fear of losing money" as a strong motivation to help users decrease their mobile phone dependence and, over time, gradually overcome addiction.

## üë• Target Audience
